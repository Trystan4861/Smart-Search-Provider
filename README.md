## Overview

**Smart Search Provider** is a minimalist extension for Visual Studio Code that supercharges your global search experience without adding any visible UI, configuration screens, or commands. Just install it, and you're done.

## Main Purpose

Have you ever tried searching for code or text in VSCode after copying it from another application, only to find no results—even though you know the word appears in your files? This is often caused by an invisible trailing space that is accidentally copied—so instead of searching for `welcome`, you search for `welcome `. VSCode's search matches exactly, so `welcome` (no trailing space) will not be found.

**Smart Search Provider** automatically fixes these mismatches, ensuring that your search finds what you expect, even if extra spaces sneak in during copy-paste.

## How it works

After installation, this extension seamlessly integrates with VSCode's built-in global search. Simply press **Ctrl+Shift+F** (or Cmd+Shift+F on macOS) as usual to start searching. The extension enhances result accuracy and performance behind the scenes, requiring no extra steps or learning curve.

- **No interface is shown:** There are no new menu options, panels, buttons, or settings pages.
- **Pure productivity:** Your workflow remains uninterrupted, and you get better results instantly.

## Features

- 🪶 **Invisible Integration**: Works silently without cluttering your editor.
- ⚡ **Enhanced Search**: Improves search relevance and speed automatically.
- 🛠️ **Zero Configuration**: No setup or options. Works out-of-the-box after installation.
- 🔒 **Privacy Respectful**: No data is sent anywhere; everything happens locally.

## Usage

Just use the regular global search (**Ctrl+Shift+F**) in VSCode. The extension does all its magic in the background.
